# Digit-Recognition

The implementation is taken from "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" book by M. Nielsen 

Click [Here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) to see the book. It's an amazing book for beginners in Neural Networks.

It contains two modules, network.py and network2.py which respectively is:
for basic SGD implementation using the distance function as cost function, 
for SGD implementation with cross-entropy cost funtion, L^{2}-regularization term added to avoid overfitting and increasing accuracy score !

There is also svm.py module which tests the SVM on MNIST dataset and gives a pretty much satisfying accuracy score ! 

The mnist.pkl.gz is the mnist dataset that is pickled.

The other files are pretty much self-explanatory.
